# twitterAPI
A practice to get my hands dirty on how to use API. Here, I'll be using twitterAPI. Feel free to comment and let's collaborate ;)

For a better understanding before using this code, It's much better to see the tutorial on how to use twitter API.
Therea are several things need to prepare :
 1. Make sure you already have twitter developers account. Check it on dev.twitter.com
 2. install twitter npm. Click "npm install twit" on your cmd. Before you install this, Make sure you've already setup the folder for 
    the twitter experiment
